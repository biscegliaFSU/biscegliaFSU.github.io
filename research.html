	  <h1 style="text-align:center">Project Research</h1>
	  <h2 style="text-align:center">Nicholas Bisceglia<br>Web Programming (CSC 3050-01)<br>Wednesday 03 November 2021</h2>
	  <h2>Introduction</h2>
	  <h3>What is the website about?</h3>
	  <p>For my website, I’ve decided to focus on the time zones of the world and conversions between different times.</p>
	  <h3>What is the website’s purpose?</h3>
	  <p>The purpose of the website is to provide information about all current time zones, and allow for comparisons between the user’s current time zone and these other time zones. I plan to create a different page of the site to give information about each time zone, I can use a standardized HTML design and a single CSS file to apply styling to all of these pages to make this manageable. The website will also contain a page that can be used to convert between different time zones, which will be the main JavaScript component of the website. These pages will all be accessible from the main page of the site, and it will have a graphical representation of all these different time zones, which I expect to be a major CSS component of the site.</p>
	  <h3>Who is the target audience?</h3>
	  <p>The website would be useful to people who need to convert between time zones or find out what the time is at another location.</p>
	  <h3>What does the target audience want from the website?</h3>
	  <p>The target audience can use the website to find out more information about various time zones, find what time it is at other places in the world, and can also use it to convert between time zones.</p>
	  <h2>Competitive Research</h2>
	  <h3>Are there other websites on your topic?</h3>
	  <p>There are several other websites that have a similar focus, such as <a href="https://timeanddate.com">TimeAndDate.com</a>, <a href="https://timezoneconverter.com">TimeZoneConverter.com</a>, <a href="https://dateful.com">Dateful.com</a>, <a href="https://time.is">Time.is</a>, and others.</p>
	  <h3>What are other sites doing? What are they successful at? What are they unsuccessful at?</h3>
	  <p>Some of these websites simply have a single page for converting between time zones, and do not offer information on each time zone, such as countries, prominent cities, and daylight saving time observations. <a href="https://timeanddate.com">TimeAndDate.com</a> seems to be the most successful of these sites, containing lots of information, facts, conversion utilities, and several other things as well, such as holiday dates, astronomical calendars, and weather forecasts.</p>
	  <h3>How can your site be better or different than the competitors?</h3>
	  <p>I intend to make my site better by including more information, such as listing the countries & major cities in each time zone and providing daylight saving time info as well. As some of these sites, such as <a href="https://timeanddate.com">TimeAndDate.com</a>, are created and maintained by companies and professional developers, I do not expect to be able to create a website better than all of the competitors, and instead will focus on creating a few chosen elements and functions in my website.</p>
